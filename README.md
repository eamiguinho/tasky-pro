Xamarin 101 - BDD in Xamarin with Specflow & Xamarin UI Test
=====

Presentation: goo.gl/ITWen8

BDD in Xamarin with Specflow & Xamarin UI Test by Emanuel Amiguinho, following Gavin presentation, was time to bring BDD to Xamarin development and that was the main point of this presentation to basically use Specflow to fill the gap between Gherkin Feature/Steps definition and Xamarin.UITest framework to have the best UI test coverage possible and good documentation that everyone inside of your team can understand (technical and non-technical personnel).
